          Hey there 👋🏽,
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is <span class="font-extrabold">Omid Majdi</span> (he/they). I’m a product person, and these are my passions in life (in no particular order): 
          <ul class="font-bold">
            <li>🎹 Music</li>
            <li>📱 Technology</li>
            <li>⚾️ The Dodgers</li>
            <li>👾 Videogames</li>
            <li>🍕 Food</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that products, at their core, solve problems. My curiosity to solve problems has led me to develop broad, yet very deep, skillsets across the product spectrum from <strong>design</strong> 🎨 to <strong>code</strong> 🤖, <strong>data analysis</strong> 📊 to <strong>strategy</strong> 🎯, <strong>branding</strong> ™️ to <strong>marketing</strong> 🛍, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also developed a deep understanding of the significance of working with people 👫. I’ve had the responsibility and the privilege of having others call me their manager and have always approached that relationship with mutual growth 💗 as the most important goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently looking for a career that aligns with my passions, and one that is wholly me. I would love to chat about any opportunities that might be just that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
        </p>
